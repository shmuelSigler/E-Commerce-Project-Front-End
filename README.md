# My E-Commerce Project

This project was deployed with Netlify&Heroku - [E-Commerce Project](https://mern-3d-store.netlify.app/).

This  end-to-end project was made with passion and devotion. Enjoy this site and begin to explore what the catalog offers. Choose from variety of homemade 3D printed models.

All the products were printed with my own Creality Ender-5 3D printer, and each product has a unique description and a gallery of images so the customer can truly be impressed from the 3d model.

## Overview

This single page application was built on the front-end with React and designed with Bootstrap and Material-UI - my go-to tools to build an application by adding Designs and Animations that can express my excitement to the viewer, while providing a good user experience.

The back-end is built with Node.js and Express, and “under the hood” REST API and MongoDB database for functionality. Development of all server-side logic and ensuring high performance and responsiveness to requests from the front-end.
